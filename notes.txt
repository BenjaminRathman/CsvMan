what I want the csv to look like 
elo, goal diff, seniors, head to head, O-elo, O-goal diff, O-seniors, result  

elo will have to be run through the script 
goal diff will need to be calculated 
head to head is season based 


it will prob be a good idea to do this season by season with one league
